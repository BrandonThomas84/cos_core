	<h3>Why Register?</h3>
	<p>Your convention registration is how we pay for the hotel, equipment, maintenance, and administrative expenses. Every table, chair and room we utilize costs money.</p>
	<p>We believe that once you understand that the income from your registration makes this event possible and registration funds collected are used for the planning and implementation of present and future COS conventions; the reasons for registering becomes clear.</p>
	<p>Because this gathering is not a regularly scheduled meeting, rather a special event, we will require registration badges to attend all seated ticketed events. This will include attendance at the Saturday Night Main Meeting.</p>
	<p>All workshops, marathon meetings and speaker meeting during the weekend DO NOT require a registration badge.</p>
	<p>Your support of this function is greatly appreciated.</p>
