	Bids are awarded at each COS convention for the convention two years in the future. Please notify the COS Advisory Committee of your intention to make a bid approximately two months in advance of the convention where the bids will be heard. Bids should be provided in writing to the Chair of the current convention committee, for presentation to the Advisory Committee at the Friday evening Advisory Committee meeting. Bids will then be presented at an open bid meeting on Saturday. The Advisory Committee will announce the two year out location at the Saturday Night main meeting.

<p class="pretty-font large">
	If there are no complete bids at that time, the Advisory Board will grant an additional period of time (such as 60 days) for those who presented incomplete bids (and only those) to complete their bids. The two year out location will then be announced on the COS website.An Area or Regional Service Committee of Narcotics Anonymous that wishes to bid to host a future Circle of Sisters convention is asked to submit a COS Bid Form for consideration. Please refer to the COS Guidelines for detailed bid requirements.
